How to Build EMS :
  Extract Ems-Dev.zip to certain dir, for example, extract to c:\UefiSct, 
  after this step, a subdirectory named as Ems is generated.
  Default Ems packages use ActiveTcl8.4.19.5-threaded, Winpcap4.1.3, WpdPack3.0
  and libnet-1.2-rc3 for building.
  
  1. Setup Build Environment
     1) Install Microsoft Windows 7 and VS2008 in build machine
     2) Download ActiveTCL8.4.19.5 and install it into C:\Tcl
     3) Copy all *.lib from C:\Tcl\Lib to C:\UefiSct\Ems\Lib\Tcl\Lib
     4) Copy C:\Tcl\Include folder to C:\UefiSct\Ems\Lib\Tcl
     5) Download the WinPcap_4_1_3.exe and install it to system
     6) Download the 3.0-WpdPack.zip and extract it to C:\WpdPack
     7) Copy C:\WpdPack\Include folder into C:\UefiSct\Ems\Lib\WpdPack
     8) Copy C:\WpdPack\Lib folder into C:\UefiSct\Ems\Lib\WpdPack
     9) Download libnet-1.2-rc3 and build it to generate the required dll/lib file.
       (see How to Build Libnet below)
     10) Copy C:\libnet\libnet\include folder into C:\UefiSct\Ems\Lib\libnet
     11) Copy all *.h from C:\libnet\libnet\win32 to C:\UefiSct\Ems\Lib\libnet\include
     12) Copy C:\libnet\libnet\src\libnet.dll into C:\UefiSct\Ems\Lib\libnet\lib
     13) Copy C:\libnet\libnet\src\libnet.dll into C:\UefiSct\Ems\Bin
     14) Copy C:\libnet\libnet\src\libnet.lib into C:\UefiSct\Ems\Lib\libnet\lib
 
  2. Build Step
     1) Run Visual Studio 2008 Command Prompt to go to the command line environment.
     2) Execute follow commands in turn.
         a) cd C:\UefiSct\Ems\src
         b) set ems_dir=C:\UefiSct\Ems
         c) nmake
     3) an Ems.exe executable file will be generated under the bin directory.

  Notice:
  1. When running UEFI SCT remote validation, user needs to keep the test topology
     environment clean. Users could use one network cable to connect the EFI target
     machine and management host machine directly.
  2. If you want to run UEFI SCT with local execution usage, you need to make
     sure the "\Sct\.passive.mode" file is removed.
  3. The passive mode of the UEFI SCT depends on network stacks.

How to Build Libnet:
  Default Libnet-1.2-rc3 depends on WinPcap-4.1.2 developer's pack for building.
  
  1. Download libnet-1.2-rc3 from http://github.com/sam-github/libnet (eg.to C:\libnet).   
  2. Download WinPcap-4.1.2 developer's pack from https://www.winpcap.org/devel.htm 
     and extract it into the same directory as libnet-1.2-rc3 (eg. If libnet-1.2-rc3 
     is downloaded to C:\libnet, copy the WpdPack folder to C:\).
  3. Copy C:\UefiSct\Ems\Patch\libnet-12-rc3.patch into the downloaded libnet
  4. Apply the patch with the git command: "git apply libnet-12-rc3.patch"
  5. Open Visual Studio 2008 Command Prompt and run
     C:\libnet\libnet\msvcbuild.bat, then the required libnet.dll and libnet.lib files 
     have been generated in C:\libnet\libnet\src\
